This directory is intended to be an example on how to build your MUX. It
contains some example configuration files, the Startmux script to start the
MUX, and a basic set of 'mechs and maps to use, taken from 3030MUX. The
'mechs are courtesy of Cord Awtry (Spectre). The maps prefixed with 'gb.'
were contributed by Greg Taylor (aka Grant Blackman.)

It also contains a skeleton database, which is started by running Startmux.
It contains two characters, the God character 'Blake' with the password
'3030rox', and the Wizard character 'Focus', with the password 'foo'. It
contains some example code, that is all. Feel free to offer contributions if
you wish. However, the database isn't intended to become a ready-to-run MUX
of the quality of some of the larger MUXen out there. A lot of work is
involved, and it stays a learning experience. This database is purely a
simple example.

Nevertheless, have fun with what is here. To run the example database, make
sure the binaries are in place in bin/, and run './Startmux'. This will
start the MUX on port 3030.
