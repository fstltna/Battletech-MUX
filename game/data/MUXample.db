"%rWelcome to this Btech MUX example. There isn't much to see here, just a basic example on how to use the btech codebase. If you look, you'll see an exit to an example sim bay. It contains a single simpod. Examine it, and examine the contents, and you'll be able to create more like it. Examine the bay and you'll be able to create more maps and bays. Use wiznews for more background information. Don't forget to use 'HELP' (all caps) and 'HELP ALL' around or in xcode objects, they contain a lot of information. Likewise for @viewxcode from inside xcode objects.%r%rIf you type @clist, you'll see a list of channels that the hcode uses. The names should be fairly self-explanatory, but when in doubt, use the source. Likewise, you should be able to .add macro 0, which contains a very basic macro set. And with the source you should have received a bunch of maps and close to a thousand 'mech and vehicle templates, donated by 3030 MUX. These, too, should serve as examples.%r%rThere are currently two characters in this MUX: Blake, who is God, and Focus, who is close to Blake. Blake should own as little as possible, but you need him to make more wizards. Focus is just a token wizard. Feel free to rename either, and don't forget to change their passwords.%r%rThis MUX is just an example. You shouln't trust the scode enough to build a site out of it, it's only intended to be an example and probably not secure.%r%r%tHave fun, -Focus."
