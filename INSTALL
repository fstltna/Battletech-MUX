To compile the Battletech MUX source, 'cd' into the 'Battletech-MUX' directory
and type './configure'. This will autodetect some values for your system. When
it is done, type 'make'.

If you want to run the example database in the game/ directory, you can run
'make install' to move the executables to the right place. Otherwise, move
them to your own game/bin directory.

To run the example database, cd into the 'game' directory after running
'make install', and run './Startmux'. Also see the README in the 'game'
directory.

The example database in game/ is purely that, an example. It does not,
currently, contain anything really useful on a production site.
